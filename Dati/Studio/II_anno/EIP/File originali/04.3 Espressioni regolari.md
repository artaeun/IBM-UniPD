# 4.3 Espressioni regolari

#### Cosa sono?
In computing, a regular expression, also referred to as “regex” or “regexp”, provides a concise and flexible means for matching strings of text, such as particular characters, words, or patterns of characters.

A regular expression is written in a formal language that can be interpreted by a regular expression processor.
| character | how it works |
| --------- | ------------ |
| ^ |Matches the beginning of a line|
|$ |Matches the end of the line|
|. |Matches any character|
|\s |Matches whitespace|
|\S |Matches any non-whitespace character|
|\d |Matches digit|
|\D |Matches any non-digit character|
|* |Repeats a character zero or more times|
|*? |Repeats a character zero or more times (non-greedy)|
|+ |Repeats a character one or more times|
|+? |Repeats a character one or more times (non-greedy)|
|[aeiou] |Matches a single character in the listed set|
|[^XYZ] |Matches a single character not in the listed set|
|[a-z0-9] |The set of characters can include a range|
|( |Indicates where string extraction is to start|
|) |Indicates where string extraction is to end|


```python
import re
re.search() #returns match object
re.findall() #extracts portions of a string that matches regular expression
```
##### find() 
```python
hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
  line = line.rstrip()
  if line.find('From:') >= 0:
    print(line)
```
##### vs re.search()
```python
import re

hand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in hand:
  line = line.rstrip()
  y= re.search('From:', line) :
  if y is not None:
    print(line)
```
* The dot character matches any character
* If you add the asterisk character, the character is “any number of times”
* ^ => math the start of the line

WildCard Characters ex: _^X.*:_ => match any character zero or more times
WildCard Characters ex2: _^X-\S+:_ => match any non-whitespace character one or more times

Altro esempio:
```python
>>> import re
>>> x = 'My 2 favorite numbers are 19 and 42'
>>> y = re.findall('[0-9]+',x)
>>> print(y)
['2', '19', '42']
```

When we use re.findall(), it returns a list of zero or more sub-strings that match the regular expression.

```python
>>> import re
>>> x = 'My 2 favorite numbers are 19 and 42'
>>> y = re.findall('[0-9]+',x)
>>> print(y)
['2', '19', '42']
>>> y = re.findall('[AEIOU]+',x)
>>> print(y)
[]
```

#### Greedy Matching

The repeat characters (* and +) push outward in both directions (greedy) to match the largest possible string.

```python
>>> import re
>>> x = 'From: Using the : character'
>>> y = re.findall('^F.+:', x)
>>> print(y)
['From: Using the :']
```

#### Non-Greedy Matching

Not all regular expression repeat codes are greedy! If you add a ? character, the + and * chill out a bit...


```python
>>> import re
>>> x = 'From: Using the : character'
>>> y = re.findall('^F.+?:', x)
>>> print(y)
['From:']
```

You can even go crazy on string extraction:

```python
>>> y = re.findall('\S+@\S+',x)
>>> print(y)
['stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za’]
```
